Overview
This is a simple Shopping System Project implemented in C++. The project aims to simulate a basic shopping system where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and complete the purchase. It is designed for educational purposes to help beginners understand the fundamentals of C++ programming and object-oriented concepts.

Features
User Authentication: Users can log in or sign up to access the shopping system.
Product Catalog: Browse a list of available products with details such as name, price, and quantity.
Shopping Cart: Add products to the shopping cart and manage the cart contents.
Checkout Process: Simulate the process of completing a purchase.
File I/O: Data is stored and loaded from text files, simulating a basic database.
Technologies Used
C++: The core programming language used for implementation.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Concepts like classes and objects are employed to model real-world entities.
File Handling: Input/output operations are used to read and write data to files.
